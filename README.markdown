2. Enable it by selecting "redirection_manager" in the list, choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply

## Usage

After installation a "Redirection Manager" menu item will appear within Symphony with two sub menu items.

1. Rules -  Create expressions to redirect URLs.
2. Logs - A log of all redirects and 404 errors on your website.
